/**
 * This is the package-info.java file for the FileIO package.
 * 
* The FileIO program will read from the input.txt file with integers,
* decimal and non numerics on each line.
* It will then try to convert each of the different data types
* from a string to an integer.
* If it is successful, it will add the integer to the sum and
* display the sum of the integers on the line.
* If it is not successful, it will display an error message.
* If there are no integers on the line, it will display an error message.
* It will then write the output to the output.txt file.
